- Explanation: The image displays a dish that appears to contain mainly cooked leafy greens and pieces of meat, possibly chicken. There is a lack of visible starchy components such as rice or potatoes which would significantly contribute to the complex sugars content. The simple sugars present might be from the natural content found in the greens, which is typically low. The meat provides a source of protein and some fats, which could be from both the meat itself and any oils used in cooking. The amount of dietary fiber would come primarily from the greens. A 1 Swiss Franc coin is present and using its known diameter for size comparison, this can help approximate the portion sizes on the plate. Given this, a rough estimate of the total weight of the meal can be made, although the actual weight can vary depending on the density and the amount of liquid in the dish."

- Explanation: The plate comprises tuna salad with visible mayonnaise, capers, and potentially other vegetables mixed in, boiled egg, cheese, and two slices of whole grain bread. Tuna and egg provide proteins. Cheese and mayonnaise contribute fats, and the amount of visible mayonnaise also adds a small amount of simple sugars. The whole grain bread is a source of complex carbohydrates and dietary fibers. The 1 Swiss Franc coin as a reference suggests the bread slices are standard size, and the other components are in modest portions, leading to the approximate estimations."

- Explanation: The image shows a piece of butter, which is primarily composed of fats. There are no visible simple or complex sugars or dietary fibers as these are not present in butter. There are trace amounts of protein in butter, but it's not significant enough to consider in a small portion like this. The presence of the fork and the coin gives an idea of the scale, and based on the known size of the coin, the piece of butter appears to be a small pat, commonly around 5 to 10 grams in weight. The estimates are rounded to whole numbers."

- Explanation: The meal appears to consist of a loaf of bread, a kiwi fruit, a yogurt cup, and a cup of espresso. Using the Swiss Franc coin as a reference, the width of the bread can be estimated at around 10-12 cm. The kiwi and yogurt cup can be visually compared to the coin to approximate their sizes.

The bread likely contains complex carbohydrates with some protein and fiber, with its estimated weight contributing most of the meal's weight. The kiwi provides dietary fiber and some simple sugars. The yogurt, depending on whether it's sweetened and flavored, can contribute both simple and complex sugars as well as protein and fat. Finally, the espresso adds negligible weight and no significant nutrition, except for some simple sugars if sugar is added.

The estimated grams for each component are rounded to whole numbers and should be taken as a rough estimation because actual values can vary based on the specific type and amount of each food item."

Explanation: The meal consists of chopped tomatoes, which are low in simple sugars but do contribute a small amount, cheese that is high in fats and proteins, and bread which provides complex sugars and some dietary fiber. There are no obvious sources of high simple sugar content like industrial sugar or honey. Using the 1 Swiss Franc coin for scale, it's estimated the plate's total diameter is around 25 cm. The overall meal weight is an educated guess based on the volume and density of the ingredients."

Explanation: The image shows a plate of cut fruits, which primarily contains simple sugars that come from the natural fructose found in the fruits. The complexity of sugars in fruits is relatively low, as they do not contain significant amounts of starch or whole grains. Protein content in fruits is also typically minimal, whereas the fat content is generally low unless the fruits are coated with a dressing or sauce, which doesn't appear to be the case here. Fruits are a good source of dietary fibers. The Swiss Franc coin provides a reference for the scale, estimating the plate's diameter at around 20 cm and the volume of cut fruits at approximately 250 grams."

Explanation: The image shows two slices of white bread, which primarily contain complex carbohydrates (starch). Commercial white bread typically has low amounts of simple sugars unless it's a sweetened variety. The slices are relatively high in complex carbohydrates since white bread is made from refined flour. There's a moderate amount of protein as is typical for bread, and minimal dietary fiber since white bread is not whole grain. Fats are generally low in white bread unless it's enriched with additional fats or oils. The presence of a 1 Swiss Franc coin with a diameter of 23.22 mm allows us to estimate the size of each bread slice. Using the coin as a reference, each slice can be approximately 12 cm long and 10 cm wide. Considering the volume of the slices, we can estimate the weight to be around 45 grams each, totaling 90 grams for both slices."

- Explanation: The image shows a salad which is mainly composed of leafy greens, some shredded carrots, and tomato. Salads are typically low in simple sugars unless they are dressed with a sweet dressing, which is not visible here. They are also not very high in complex sugars since the primary components do not include starchy vegetables or grains. Proteins are likely minimal unless there is a protein source hidden from view like cheese or nuts. Fats could come from any oil in the dressing, and dietary fibers are present in the vegetables. Without a coin for scale, this is a rough visual estimate, assuming the meal is average-sized for a side salad. The total weight takes into account the weight of the vegetables and potential dressing."

- Explanation: The meal appears to consist of a serving of steak tartare, which is made from raw ground beef, and a side of French fries. There are no overt sources of simple sugars unless the accompanying sauces or condiments contain them. The steak tartare is primarily a source of protein and some fat. The French fries are a source of complex carbohydrates (starch), some dietary fibers, and fats due to frying. Using the Swiss Franc coin as a reference, which has a diameter of 23.22 mm, the steak tartare might be approximately 12 cm in diameter and the portion of french fries could complement to reach an estimated total meal weight of around 300 grams. The weights of proteins, fats, and complex sugars are rough estimates based on standard nutritional values for these types of foods, and the real values could differ based on precise portion sizes and cooking methods. The dietary fibers are low because there appears to be a lack of high-fiber vegetables or fruits in the meal."

- Explanation: The meal consists of toasted slices of bread, which primarily contribute complex carbohydrates. There are no visible sources of simple sugars unless the bread is sweetened, which is typically minimal. Proteins, fats, and fibers are present in small quantities, as bread contains some amount of each, but not significantly. There is no coin or another common object to accurately gauge the meal's scale, but based on the standard size of bread slices and the napkin, the total weight is roughly estimated. This is a simple estimation and would vary based on the exact size of the bread slices and their density."

- Explanation: The dessert shown is a fruit-based smoothie or puree, garnished with strawberries and a raspberry sauce art on the plate, making it mainly composed of simple sugars from the fruits. There may be a small amount of complex sugars depending on whether there's any addition of grains or fiber-rich compounds; however, it appears primarily fruit-based. Protein content is likely low, deriving from any dairy or nuts if included. Fats are minimal unless there's added high-fat dairy or a topping not visible in the image. Dietary fiber comes from the whole fruits. Weight is estimated considering the volume of the glass and the density of the mixed fruits; the Swiss Franc coin offers a scale reference, with the coin's diameter suggesting the glass's volume is approximately 250-300 ml. This estimation assumes the mixture is dense and heavy due to the fruit content."

- Explanation: The yogurt appears to be a single-serving container, which is often around 150-200 grams. Given the coin's size, the yogurt container is larger, but not by a great deal. Since it’s lemon-flavored yogurt, it likely contains added sugars for taste. Yogurts typically have natural sugars (lactose) and some added sugars, especially in flavored varieties. Assuming it is not a Greek yogurt, proteins would be moderate. Without visible pieces of fruit or whole grains, dietary fiber content would be negligible. There might be minimal fats unless it's a low-fat or non-fat yogurt. The weight is an approximation based on the size comparison with the coin and typical sizes of yogurt containers."

- Explanation: The meal in the picture includes what appears to be a meatloaf or patty, grilled potatoes, roasted tomatoes, and cauliflower. There seems to be minimal use of simple sugars unless added during cooking. The complex sugars come primarily from the potatoes as starch. The meat provides a generous amount of protein, while fats are present in the meal both within the meat and from any oil used for grilling or roasting. The vegetables contribute to the dietary fibers. The 1 Swiss Franc coin, which measures 23.22 mm in diameter, allows for an estimation of the portion sizes. The overall meal is likely to weigh around 500 grams given the volume of food on the plate."

Explanation: The image shows a bottle of Gatorade, which is a sports drink primarily containing water, simple sugars, electrolytes, and flavoring. It doesn't have significant amounts of protein, fat, or dietary fibers. Using the 1 Swiss Franc coin for scale, the bottle appears to be a standard size, which usually holds around 500 ml to 600 ml. Since sugars are dissolved in the liquid, assuming the lower end of sports drink sugar content averages, it might contain around 30 grams of simple sugars. The total weight of the liquid is estimated to be around 600 grams, which accounts for the volume of liquid plus the weight of the container itself."

Explanation: This meal consists of leafy greens that are high in fibers, a few slices of wholemeal bread which is a source of complex carbohydrates, some slices of processed meat which provide proteins and some fats, and a small pat of butter that increases the fat content. There's also a jar that might contain jam or other preserves, which could add a small amount of simple sugars if used sparingly. The presence of a 1 Swiss Franc coin, which has a diameter of 23.22mm, helps approximate the size of the different items on the plate. The total quantity of food is moderate, suggesting a meal roughly around 300 grams in total weight. The overall nutritional values are estimates and would vary based on the precise amounts and types of each food item."
16,017.jpg,"Grapefruit yogurt, kiwi and bread and coffee",384,Unbalance,Good quality,2014:10:05 06:33:31,30,60,10,15,5,500,"Simple sugars (g): 30

Explanation: The meal appears to consist of several slices of whole grain bread, a sliced kiwi, a container of yogurt, a cup of espresso, and a jar that seems to be a preserve or jam. The presence of the 1 Swiss Franc coin helps with scale. Assuming each bread slice is around 30g (standard for whole grain bread) and there appear to be three slices, that would give us about 90g of weight, primarily consisting of complex sugars (starches) and some dietary fibers. The kiwi is a fruit rich in dietary fiber and some simple sugars, and one medium kiwi weighs about 70g. The yogurt container, depending on the type, can weigh around 200g, which may include dairy proteins and fats along with added sugars, and the espresso has negligible calories. The preserve adds more simple sugars, and if one tablespoon was spread over the bread, that would be around 20g. Adding all meal components, the estimated total weight is about 500g."

- Explanation: In the image, we see an apple, which contains natural sugars (both simple and complex), negligible fats, some dietary fiber, and minimal protein. The dextrose (also known as glucose) tablets are a source of simple sugars. Based on the size of the 1 Swiss Franc coin, the apple can be estimated to weigh around 150 grams, while a standard dextrose tablet weighs approximately 3.5 grams each (likely a bit less as they aren't new). Assuming there are ten tablets shown, that adds an additional 35 grams, leading to a rough estimate of 185 grams for the total meal weight, which I have rounded up slightly to 200 grams to account for any potential underestimation of the apple's weight. The apple would contribute most of the dietary fiber and complex sugars, while the dextrose tablets contribute primarily to the simple sugar content."

- Weight (g): 500
- Explanation: The meal depicted contains cooked pasta, what appears to be some type of chicken in sauce, and cooked celery. Pasta is rich in complex carbohydrates, generally providing about 30 grams of carbs per 100-gram serving. Given the coin for scale, the portion of pasta looks to be approximately 130-150 grams. The chicken in sauce will contribute primarily to the protein content, and sauces often contain fats, which I've estimated moderately. Chicken is a lean source of protein; roughly 100 grams of cooked chicken provides around 30 grams. Eyeballing the chicken portion next to the coin, it seems like there could be about 80-100 grams. Cooked celery contributes negligibly to sugars and fats, but provides some dietary fiber. Overall, the meal seems balanced, with a moderate amount of each macronutrient. The coin, compared to the food items and plate, helps in estimating the portions, but given that the angle and perspective can distort perception, these remain estimates."

- Explanation: The image shows oatmeal cookies or energy bites, which are rich in complex carbohydrates from oats and possibly dried fruits such as raisins. These components contribute to the dietary fibers as well. The presence of seeds or nuts can add to the fats and proteins. Simple sugars may come from any added sweeteners such as honey or sugar, but the amount seems minimal based on typical recipes. The total weight is estimated using the 1 Swiss Franc coin for scale. Considering the size of each oatmeal cookie compared to the coin, the weight of a single cookie might be around 30-40 grams, hence with multiple pieces shown, a rough estimate for the meal would be around 300 grams."

Explanation: This meal comprises several slices of mortadella, a portion of cheese, slices of whole-grain bread, a green salad, and two strawberries. The strawberries provide a minimal amount of simple sugars. The whole-grain bread is a source of complex carbs and dietary fibers. The mortadella and cheese contribute to the protein and fat content. The salad offers additional fiber. Given no coin for size reference is present, I cannot accurately gauge the size of each portion, but based on a general estimation of the plate size and typical food serving sizes, the weights of each component are approximated as stated."

- Explanation: The meal consists of several slices of whole grain bread, a container of yogurt, and a jar of what appears to be jam, all on a plate. These items are typically high in complex sugars (from the grains in the bread), with some proteins (from the yogurt), and fats (from both the yogurt and the bread if it contains any added fats). The jam will contribute to simple sugars but the quantity spread on the bread is likely small. Whole grain bread also offers dietary fiber. Estimating the meal's weight takes into account the average slice of bread weighs around 30-40 grams, and the yogurt might be approximately 125-150 grams. The 1 Swiss Franc coin provides a reference for the size of the plate and the food portions. The spoon and knife offer additional clues to the scale. The estimate aims for a modest portion size often associated with a snack or light meal."

- Explanation: The image shows a jar of honey and a container of lemon yogurt. Honey is primarily composed of simple sugars, mainly fructose and glucose. There are no complex sugars, proteins, or dietary fibers visibly present in the honey, but there might be trace amounts of minor nutrients not quantifiable in this estimation. The lemon yogurt typically contains some protein and a small amount of fat, and it may also have some added sugars; however, without knowing the specific brand and variety, an approximation is used here. The yogurt likely has negligible dietary fiber since it does not contain whole fruits or additional fiber sources. Depending on the capacity of the jar and the yogurt container, the combined weight of the honey and yogurt could be around 250 grams, keeping in mind that honey is denser than water and yogurt varies in density. The lemon yogurt container, typically around 150 grams, thus can help approximate the volume and weight of the honey jar."

- Explanation: The meal appears to include a pre-packaged sandwich with roasted beef and some kind of salad, along with a packaged dessert, possibly a chocolate-covered wafer. The sandwich likely has complex carbohydrates from the bread and some dietary fiber from the salad, and proteins from the beef. The dessert will have simple sugars and fats from the chocolate and wafers. Without the presence of a Swiss Franc coin in the image, I estimate the meal's weight by comparing the packaging size to standard sizes available in markets. The sandwich would weigh around 150-200 grams and the chocolate wafer bar approximately 100 grams, roughly summing up to 300 grams for the meal. Nutritional content is estimated based on typical content for similar products."
