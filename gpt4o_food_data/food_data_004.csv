Explanation: The meal consists of a small portion of mixed greens (lettuce, arugula, and beet leaves), shredded carrots, a segment of baguette, and a drizzle of creamy dressing. 

- The vegetables, predominantly leafy greens, and carrots, contribute mainly to dietary fibers and a small amount of simple sugars and proteins.
- The piece of whole grain bread (baguette) is a source of complex carbohydrates and some proteins.
- The creamy salad dressing adds to the fat content, likely from oils or mayonnaise, and potentially some simple sugars.
- Given the reference of the 23.22 mm diameter 1 Swiss Franc coin, this plate is estimated around 200 grams in weight. 

This estimation considers the light nature of the salad and the presence of relatively minor portions of each ingredient."

Explanation: The meal consists of roasted potatoes, a piece of salmon topped with a creamy sauce, some sprouts, and a couple of cherry tomato halves. The roasted potatoes contribute mostly to the complex sugars and some fibers. The salmon provides a substantial amount of protein and fats. The creamy sauce adds additional fats and possibly a little bit of simple sugars. The sprouts and tomatoes add dietary fibers and a small amount of simple sugars. The presence of the 1 Swiss Franc coin helps in estimating the portion sizes and thus the weight and nutritional content of the meal."

Explanation: Using the 1 Swiss Franc coin to estimate the dimensions and volume of the meal, the pasta dish appears to be primarily composed of spaghetti (complex sugars and carbohydrates), and includes a notable amount of vegetables such as mushrooms, bell peppers, and leafy greens (dietary fibers and some protein). There is a probable presence of oil or other fat sources used in the cooking process. Simple sugars are minimal, possibly contributed by bell peppers or any used sauces. The entire plate seems to weigh around 400 grams based on the portion size and visual volume approximation."

Explanation: The meal consists predominantly of fried potato pieces, likely French fries, and a serving of what appears to be a breaded and possibly cheese-topped dish, which could include some meat or fish. By estimating the Swiss Franc coin's diameter of 23.22 mm, the portion size suggests that the fries and the breaded item are moderate in quantity.

- The fries contribute to the complex sugars, fats, and dietary fibers. 
- The breaded item, probably with cheese, contributes to proteins and fats, with some of the cheese or sauce contributing simple sugars.
- The overall weight, judging by the size of the plate and the portions, is estimated at around 250 grams, with the food not covering the entire plate indicating moderate servings."

Explanation: The meal consists of fried fish and roasted potatoes. The fish provides a good source of protein and fat, especially due to the frying method which adds extra oil. The potatoes are a source of complex carbohydrates, and since they still have some skin, they also contribute a small amount of dietary fiber. Using the 1 Swiss Franc coin as a reference for scale, the portion sizes are moderate but not excessively large, leading to the estimated total meal weight."

Explanation: The meal appears to consist of a slice of pizza with cheese, ham, and some vegetable toppings, alongside a bread roll. The 1 Swiss Franc coin provides a reference for sizing. Based on this reference:
- The pizza slice is estimated to be about 220 grams, consisting mainly of the crust (complex sugars), cheese (fats and proteins), ham (proteins), and tomato sauce (small amount of simple sugars).
- The bread roll is estimated to weigh around 100 grams, contributing to the complex sugars and some proteins.
- Additional simple sugars come from the tomato sauce used on the pizza. 
- Dietary fibers come primarily from any vegetables on the pizza and the whole grains in the crust or bread roll."

Explanation: The image shows a pizza with a mixture of ingredients such as tomato sauce, cheese, prosciutto, tomatoes, and basil leaves. Using the 1 Swiss Franc coin as a scale reference, the pizza appears to be around 30 cm in diameter.

- Simple sugars: The tomato sauce likely contains some simple sugars, estimated around 12 grams.
- Complex sugars: The pizza crust, made of refined flour, is rich in complex carbohydrates, estimated around 80 grams.
- Proteins: The prosciutto and cheese provide a substantial amount of protein, estimated around 25 grams.
- Fats: Cheese and prosciutto contribute a significant amount of fats, estimated around 18 grams.
- Dietary fibers: The tomatoes and basil leaves add dietary fibers, estimated around 5 grams.
- Weight: Considering the pizza's size and the toppings, the total weight of the meal is estimated to be around 400 grams."

Explanation: The meal consists of sliced ham and white rice. Based on the Swiss Franc coin (23.22 mm diameter) in the picture, I estimate the portion sizes. There are no visible fruits or vegetables to contribute to dietary fibers or simple sugars. The complex sugars come from the white rice, estimated at around 150 grams cooked, providing approximately 50 grams of complex sugars. The protein content primarily comes from the ham, estimated at around 50 grams, giving about 15 grams of protein. The fat content is mostly from the ham, estimated at around 5 grams. The total weight of the meal is approximated by summing up the weights of the rice and ham, resulting in about 200 grams."
